# Celestial Object Creator

The Celestial Object Creator is a Python tool designed to interact with the Crossmint Challenge API for creating and managing celestial objects in a virtual map. This tool automates the placement of various celestial entities, including Polyanets, Soloons, and comeths, according to specific rules and configurations provided by the challenge.

## Features

- **Automated Creation**: Easily create celestial objects on the map with specified positions and additional attributes.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the timing and handling of API requests to accommodate rate limits and improve performance.
- **Extensible Design**: Add more celestial object types and functionalities as needed with minimal adjustments to the existing codebase.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

> python create_megaverse.py

The script will automatically fetch the goal map configuration from the Crossmint API, create the specified celestial objects, and print any errors encountered during the process.
